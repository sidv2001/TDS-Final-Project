To generate the results seen, please run the data cleaning.ipynb file to first generate the cleaned dataset, and then run data_EDA.ipynb and data_analysis.ipynb respectively. 

WARNING:
The cumulative time to run the experiments ended up being quite long on our systems and on google collab (mainly the evaluation given the size of the dataset). data_analysis.ipynb will take greater than 24 hours to run.
